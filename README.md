# hero-skills

It is a little demo about modifying point skill of heroes.

### Used Packages

**React**: JS Framework

**TypeScript**: It's s a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

**Styled-Components**: It allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

**Eslint**: It can define rules to keep code style consistent and help me find and fix problems with your JavaScript code.

**Prettier**: It is an opinionated code formatter that supports a lot of different programming languages, like: JavaScript. JSON. JSX. CSS.

**Axios**: Axios is a promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and handle the transformation of request and response data.

**React Router DOM**: It enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is handled in a configuration outside a running app, React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform.

### Comment Principle

Only comment things e.g. `// TODO` if the code is uncompleted or will be used in the future.

### Obstacles to overcome

First time using `styled-component`, figuring out the art of decomposing components in the most efficient way took me some time, but I eventually did it by observing common factors and extracting them out along the way.

### Folder Structure

+ /src/api - axios Instance and APIs

+ /src/components - reusable components

+ /src/const - constant data for initializing or dummy data

+ /src/pages - page components

+ /src/types - types used in the project
